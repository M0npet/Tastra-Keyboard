# Word pairs (next-word suggestions)

`<lang>.txt` lists how often one word followed another (previous word, next
word, count) in the corpora below, built with `tools/build-bigrams.py`. Only
counts of adjacent words were taken: no sentences or other text. The test
parts of the corpora were left out. A pair counts only when both words are in
the bundled frequency list of the language; pairs seen once are dropped. For
German, a next word that was mostly capitalised after the previous one is
listed capitalised ("das Unternehmen").
